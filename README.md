# Description

This is a code along with a book called Data Structures the Fun Way by Jeremy Kubica. I create a branch for every chapter. I add tests and and some runtime output. Once the branch is complete I merge the branch to main and delete it. If there are questions about this look at `git town` and specifically `git town ship`.

## Comments

I don't expect anyone to look at this repo becuase I am focused on my own education. I'm a pretty good dev already, I am just working on this kind of sutff to reinforce my current understanding. I do a bunch of other code along books in other languages and I always think that they are fun.
